### Tempest addon: Qord

Qord allows Tempest based Discord Apps/Bots use gateway as connection method. It can noticeably improve latency + allows to optionally read regular text messages which makes it possible to use legacy text based commands. Right now, there's no dedicated command handler & rate limiter is still unfinished so it's something you'll have to figure out on your own if you wish to use Qord.
